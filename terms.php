    Dispatch times may vary according to availability and any guarantees or representations made as to delivery times are subject to any delays resulting from postal delays or force majeure for which we will not be responsible.
    In order to contract with Zooqie you must be over 18 years of age and possess a valid credit or debit card issued by a bank acceptable to us. Zooqie retains the right to refuse any request made by you. If your order is accepted PayPal will inform you by email and will confirm the identity of the party which you have contracted with. This will be a third party. Where a contract is made with a third party, Zooqie is not acting as either agent or principal and the contract is made between yourself and that third party and will be subject to the terms of sale which they supply you. When placing an order you undertake that all details you provide to us are true and accurate, that you are an authorised user of the credit or debit card used to place your order and that there are sufficient funds to cover the cost of the goods. The cost of foreign products and services may fluctuate. All prices advertised are subject to such changes.

Where applicable, prices are inclusive of VAT. Delivery costs will be charged in addition; such additional charges are clearly displayed where applicable and included in the 'Total Cost'.

    				<div>
    					<p> As a reputable and trusted business committed to offering its customers high quality products, Zooqie recognizes its obligation to ensure that suppliers are operating ethically.
    We expect our suppliers to consistently provide an environment which protects their employees' health and safety and basic human rights.
    All suppliers are expected to comply with their national employment laws and regulations with particular regard to:<br/>
    Minimum age of employment, Freely chosen employment, Health and safety, Freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, No discrimination, No harsh or inhumane treatment, Working hours, Rates of pay, Terms of employment<br/>
    Zooqie will never knowingly source stock from countries which are in breach of the above principles. We also look to our suppliers to instil these principles when dealing with their own supplier base.
    Because of the sometimes complex nature of our suppliers' supply chain, it is not always possible to monitor and control the conditions of each individual involved in the production of our products. However, as Zooqie continues to grow it recognises the importance of being proactive and doing everything within its power to support the rights of those involved in the manufacture of its goods.</p>
